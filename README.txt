There are seven tables (k, l, m, n, o, p, q) and seven cubes (a, b, c, d, f, g, h).

Initial state: f is on p, g is on f, h is on g, b is on h, a is on q, d is on a, c is on d.
Final state: a is on n, d is on a, c is on d, f is on c, g is on f, h is on g, b is on h.

Program finds an action plan in an environment of 7 tables and 7 cubes in order to
perform transition from initial state to final state in appropriate time.
